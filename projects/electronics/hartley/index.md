# Hartley Oscillator

A [Hartley oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartley_oscillator) is a type of electronic oscillator circuit used to generate continuous sine wave signals at a desired frequency. It was invented by Ralph Hartley in 1915 and is widely used in various applications such as radio transmitters, electronic musical instruments, and frequency synthesizers.

The basic circuit configuration of a Hartley oscillator consists of an $LC$ tank circuit (inductor $L$ and capacitor $C$) combined with an active device, typically a transistor or vacuum tube, for amplification. Here's a general description of the Hartley oscillator's operation:

1. **Tank Circuit**: The $LC$ tank circuit serves as a resonant element in the oscillator. It consists of the inductor ($L$) and capacitor ($C$) connected in parallel or series. This $LC$ combination sets the desired frequency of oscillation.

2. **Active Device**: The active device, such as a transistor, is used to amplify the signal generated by the tank circuit. It provides the necessary gain to compensate for any energy losses in the circuit and sustain the oscillations.

3. **Feedback**: A portion of the output signal from the tank circuit is fed back to the input of the amplifier through a feedback network. The feedback network is typically a portion of the inductor or capacitor in the tank circuit. This feedback creates a positive feedback loop, which enables the sustained oscillation of the circuit.

4. **Biasing**: The active device requires appropriate biasing to operate in its active region. Biasing is accomplished using a separate biasing circuit, typically involving resistors and/or capacitors, to set the operating point of the active device.

5. **Frequency Control**: The frequency of oscillation can be adjusted by varying the values of the inductor and capacitor in the tank circuit. Alternatively, variable capacitors or inductors can be used to provide frequency control.

When the circuit is powered on, the Hartley oscillator starts oscillating at its resonant frequency determined by the tank circuit's $LC$ values. The feedback from the tank circuit to the active device ensures continuous regeneration of the oscillating signal. The output is taken from the tank circuit, typically using a coupling capacitor to separate the DC bias and allow only the AC oscillating signal to pass.
