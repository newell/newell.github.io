# Paintings

Here are some paintings I have done for the house.

## Euclid's Proof of Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras' theorem, stands as a foundational principle in Euclidean geometry that establishes a crucial relationship among the three sides of a right triangle. According to this theorem, the combined area of the squares constructed on the two shorter sides is precisely equal to the area of the square formed on the longest side, also known as the hypotenuse.

The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides $$a$$, $$b$$ and the hypotenuse $$c$$, sometimes called the Pythagorean equation:

$$\begin{align}a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\end{align}$$

The theorem is named for the Greek philosopher [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras), born around 570 BC. The theorem has been proved numerous times by many different methods â€“ possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years.

This marked my very first canvas painting and I chose acrylic paints as my medium of choice. I created a model in `geogebra` with the hypotenuse at 19 cm (one of my favorite numbers) and used this as a template for dark thin tape, to make sure the proportions were correct.  I tried to color coordinate the painting for the different steps in Euclid's proof.  I am genuinely pleased with the outcome, as it brings a sense of contentment and fulfillment to my artistic and mathematical endeavors.

## Splattered Colors

A painting of splattered colors that was manifested by attaching the canvas to an electric drill with duct tape, applying blobs of paint, and then spinning it into creation.  I had seen others do this online and felt inspired to give it a try.
