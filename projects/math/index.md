# Math

I love logic, mathematics, and computation.  More so than I can convey in words.

I love starting from a set of axioms and, using the rules of logic, deducing all that follows.

I love the art of reasoning well. Connecting truths to more truth.


## Formalizing Math

A new passion of mine is formalizing mathematics with the functional programming language [Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) ([github](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4)).

I am a contributor to [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html) ([github](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4)).

Here are some links to blog posts about some of the larger pull requests I have contributed:

* [Klein-Four Group](https://newell.github.io/posts/mathlib4-klein-four)
