# Byrne's Euclid

I have self published a modern rendition of [Byrne's Euclid](https://www.amazon.com/Byrnes-Euclid-First-Books-Elements/dp/B0BZF4Z67V) on Amazon.  I employed LaTeX for the complete typesetting of this book.

It is my personal opinion that a book of this quality is a treasure to have in hand and your support would be appreciated.
However, I am also supplying a [free digital copy](https://github.com/newell/newell.github.io/assets/byrnes-euclid.pdf).

The best of both worlds is having a copy of both.

### Links

The digital copy has links to allow you to navigate around the PDF:

This comes in handy when you want to see the definitions, axioms, postulates or other theorems and propositions that are used as premises in the proof of a new proposition:
