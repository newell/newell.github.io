## Number Theory

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that is devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions.  German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) said, _"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences --- and number theory is the queen of mathematics."

The textbook we are working through is _Introduction to Analytic Number Theory_ by Tom M. Apostol.
