# Catalan Solids

A [Catalan solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_solid), also known as an Archimedean dual, refers to a polyhedron that serves as the dual counterpart to an [Archimedean solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid). There exist 13 distinct Catalan solids, named after the Belgian mathematician [Eug√®ne Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Catalan), who initially described them in 1865.

The Catalan solids possess a convex shape and are considered to be [face-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-transitive), although they are not [vertex-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex-transitive). This distinction arises because the dual Archimedean solids exhibit vertex-transitivity while lacking face-transitivity. Notably, unlike the Platonic solids and Archimedean solids, the faces of Catalan solids are not [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon). However, the [vertex figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure) of Catalan solids are regular, and these solids maintain constant [dihedral angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle). Due to their face-transitivity, Catalan solids are categorized as [isohedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isohedron).
