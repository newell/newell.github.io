# Polytopes

Welcome!  Polytopes are beautiful mathematical and geometrical objects.  I have started a collection (still growing) of 3D printed polytopes that I have constructed at home.  There is a lot of information about polytopes online and by no means am I trying to be exhaustive here, just a brief introduction to the figures I have printed.  The readership is encouraged to dig deeper online for any nagging questions that are not answered here and to dive into the mathematics behind these wonderful objects.

*TODO* add picture of entire collection here

## Crystallography and Mineralogy

This particular subsection focuses on polytopes relevant to the fields of crystallography and mineralogy. While some of the aforementioned polyhedra represent various Brillouin Zones found within crystals, one might argue that this subsection could be omitted on that basis. However, the inclusion of this subsection provides a distinct emphasis and concentration on the subject matter at hand.
