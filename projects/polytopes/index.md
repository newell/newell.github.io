# Polytopes

Welcome!  Polytopes are beautiful mathematical and geometrical objects.  I have started a collection (still growing) of 3D printed polytopes that I have constructed at home.  There is a lot of information about polytopes online and I have supplied Wikipedia links to help in your understanding of these objects.  By no means am I trying to be exhaustive here, just a brief introduction to the figures I have printed.  The readership is encouraged to dig deeper online for any nagging questions that are not answered here and to dive into the mathematics behind these wonderful objects.

## Regular 4-polytopes

A [regular 4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytope) is a regular four-dimensional [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope). They are the four-dimensional analogues of the [regular polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron) in three dimensions and the [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon) in two dimensions.

There are six [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope) and ten [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polytope) regular 4-polytopes, giving a total of sixteen.

### Regular convex 4-polytopes

The convex regular 4-polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician [Ludwig Schläfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli) in the mid-19th century. He discovered that there are precisely six such figures.

The regular convex 4-polytopes are the four-dimensional analogues of the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid) in three dimensions and the convex regular polygons in two dimensions.

Five of the six are clearly analogues of the five corresponding Platonic solids. The sixth, the 24-cell, has no regular analogue in three dimensions. However, there exists a pair of irregular solids, the cuboctahedron and its dual the rhombic dodecahedron, which are partial analogues to the 24-cell (in complementary ways). Together they can be seen as the three-dimensional analogue of the 24-cell.

Each convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional cells which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size. These are fitted together along their respective faces (face-to-face) in a regular fashion.

#### 5-cell, pentachoron, pentatope, 4-simplex

The analogue of the [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron) in four-dimensions is the [5-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cell), which also goes by the names pentachoron, pentatope, and the 4-simplex.

#### 16-cell, hexadecachoron, 4-orthoplex

the 16-cell is the regular convex 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schläfli symbol {3,3,4}. It is one of the six regular convex 4-polytopes first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. It is also called hexadecachoron, or 4-orthoplex by [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

It is a part of a family of polytopes, called [cross-polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-polytope) or orthoplexes, and is analogous to the [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron) in three dimensions.

#### 8-cell, octachoron, tesseract, 4-cube

A tesseract is the four-dimensional analogue of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Just as the surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells. The dual polytope of the tesseract is the 16-cell.

#### 24-cell, icositetrachoron, octaplex, polyoctahedron

The boundary of the 24-cell is composed of 24 octahedral cells with six meeting at each vertex, and three at each edge. Together they have 96 triangular faces, 96 edges, and 24 vertices. The vertex figure is a cube. The 24-cell is self-dual.

The 24-cell does not have a regular analogue in 3 dimensions. It is the only one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes which is not the four-dimensional analogue of one of the five regular Platonic solids. It is the unique regular polytope, in any number of dimensions, which has no regular analogue in the adjacent dimension, either below or above. However, it can be seen as the analogue of a pair of irregular solids: the cuboctahedron and its dual the rhombic dodecahedron.

#### 600-cell, hexacosichoron, tetraplex, polytetrahedron

The 600-cell's boundary is composed of 600 tetrahedral cells with 20 meeting at each vertex. Together they form 1200 triangular faces, 720 edges, and 120 vertices. It is the 4-dimensional analogue of the icosahedron, since it has five tetrahedra meeting at every edge, just as the icosahedron has five triangles meeting at every vertex. Its dual polytope is the 120-cell.

#### 120-cell, hecatonicosachoron, dodecacontachoron, dodecaplex, polydodecahedron

The boundary of the 120-cell is composed of 120 dodecahedral cells with 4 meeting at each vertex. Together they form 720 pentagonal faces, 1200 edges, and 600 vertices. It is the 4-dimensional analogue of the regular dodecahedron, since just as a dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal facets, with 3 around each vertex, the dodecaplex has 120 dodecahedral facets, with 3 around each edge. Its dual polytope is the 600-cell.
