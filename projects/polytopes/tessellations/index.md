# Honeycomb Tessellations

A [honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(geometry)) is a space filling or close packing of polyhedral or higher-dimensional cells, so that there are no gaps. It is an example of the more general mathematical *tiling* or [*tessellation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation) in any number of dimensions. Its dimension can be clarified as $$n$$-honeycomb for a honeycomb of $$n$$-dimensional space.

## Convex Uniform Honeycomb

A convex uniform honeycomb is a uniform tessellation which fills three-dimensional Euclidean space with non-overlapping convex uniform polyhedral cells.

Twenty-eight such honeycombs are known:

- the familiar cubic honeycomb and 7 truncations thereof;
- the alternated cubic honeycomb and 4 truncations thereof;
- 10 prismatic forms based on the uniform plane tilings (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);
- 5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.

They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the uniform tilings of the plane.

The Voronoi diagram of any lattice forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are zonohedra.
