# Archimedean Solids

An [Archimedean solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid) refers to one of the 13 solid shapes that were initially classified by the renowned mathematician [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes). These solids are unique among convex uniform polyhedra as they consist of regular polygons meeting at the same vertices, with the exception of the five Platonic solids (which consist of only one type of polygon), as well as the prisms, antiprisms, and the [pseudorhombicuboctahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorhombicuboctahedron). Essentially, Archimedean solids form a distinct subgroup within the [Johnson solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_solid), where the regular polygonal faces are not necessarily required to meet at identical vertices.
