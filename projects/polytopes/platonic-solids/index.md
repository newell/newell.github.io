# Platonic Solids

A [Platonic solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid) is a [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope), [regular polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron) in [three-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space). These extraordinary polyhedra possess exceptional characteristics that set them apart from other geometric shapes. Being a regular polyhedron means that the [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry)) are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry)), exhibiting identical shapes and sizes. Moreover, all angles within each face are congruent, and the edges have equal lengths. An intriguing feature of Platonic solids is that the same number of faces meet at each vertex.

The distinguished class of Platonic solids comprises only five unique polyhedra, making them a special subset within the world of three-dimensional shapes. Each of these polyhedra is celebrated for its distinct properties and symmetries. The five Platonic solids are:

1. Tetrahedron:
   - Description: This solid is composed of four equilateral triangles as faces, and three triangles meet at each vertex.
   - Schläfli symbol: $${3, 3}$$
   - Dual: Octahedron

2. Cube:
   - Description: Also known as a hexahedron, it consists of six identical square faces, with three meeting at each vertex.
   - Schläfli symbol: $${4, 3}$$
   - Dual: Octahedron

3. Octahedron:
   - Description: With eight equilateral triangular faces, it has four triangles converging at each vertex.
   - Schläfli symbol: $${3, 4}$$
   - Dual: Cube

4. Dodecahedron:
   - Description: This polyhedron has twelve regular pentagonal faces, and three pentagons meet at each vertex.
   - Schläfli symbol: $${5, 3}$$
   - Dual: Icosahedron

5. Icosahedron:
   - Description: Comprising twenty equilateral triangles, it has five triangles meeting at each vertex.
   - Schläfli symbol: $${3, 5}$$
   - Dual: Dodecahedron

Geometers have studied the Platonic solids for thousands of years. They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) who hypothesized in one of his dialogues, the [*Timaeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)), that the [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element) were made of these regular solids.
