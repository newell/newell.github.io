## Desargues's Theorem

In projective geometry, [Desargues's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s_theorem), named after [Girard Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girard_Desargues), states:

$$\begin{align} \text{Two triangles are in perspective} \textit{ axially } \text{if and only if they are in perspective} \textit{ centrally}.\end{align}$$
