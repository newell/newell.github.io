# Crystals and Crystal Forms

## Perovskite

[Perovskite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite) is a calcium titanium oxide mineral composed of calcium titanate (chemical formula $$CaTiO_3$$). Its name is also applied to the class of compounds which have the same type of crystal structure as $$CaTiO_3\ (^{XII}A^{2+VI}B^{4+}X^{2âˆ’}_3)$$, known as the perovskite structure. Many different cations can be embedded in this structure, allowing the development of diverse engineered materials.
