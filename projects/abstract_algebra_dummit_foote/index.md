# Abstract Algebra

Abstract Algebra is the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices and algebras.

The textbook we are working through is _Abstract Algebra, 3ed._ from Davis S. Dummit and Richard M. Foot.

This is a classic textbook for Abstract Algebra and with close to 2000 exercises...it's a behemoth.
