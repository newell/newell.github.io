# Reflex AM Radio Receiver

In this project I built a Reflex AM Radio Receiver.Â The schematic that I built this receiver from is shown below (note that T2's primary does not have to be center-tapped). A reflection radio receiver is a radio receiver design in which the same amplifier is used for both the radio frequency (RF) and audio frequency (AF) signals. The radio signal from the output of the amplifier passes detection and then re-enters the input of the amplifier. During the second pass, the audio frequency is amplified and then passed to the earphone. Historically, it was a way to design a cheaper receiver because it had less tube amplifiers, which were costly.
