## Current Reading List [with current position]:

Note: I honestly jump from book to book and there are many books that I have not listed below but should.  This is my lame attempt at trying to track books that I *think* I would like to finish at some point but a lot of times as I progress I realize that another source is better suited to fill my curiousity, especially with research.
