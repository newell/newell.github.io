# Mathematics _IS_ Art

Gempillar believes the beauty of Mathematics _IS_ Art and we try and do our best communicating this using different mediums such paintings, video animations, and the demonstrations of mathematical proofs.

Gempillar is a Platonist, in the same sense as H.S.M Coxeter quotes:

_"I'm a Platonist --- a follower of Plato --- who believes that one didn't invent these sort of things, that one discovers them.  In a sense, all these mathematical facts are right there waiting to be discovered."_

Come, let us discover these facts together.
