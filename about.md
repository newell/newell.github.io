# Gempillar Origins

_Gempillar_ is a company started in 2020 by Newell Jensen that focuses on communicating the knowledge and beauty of mathematics to the masses.

A newel, also called a central pole or support column, is the central supporting pillar of a staircase.  As the anchor of the stairway, a newel must be strong and steadfast to ensure the integrity of the stairwell.  Crystals of the highest quality are usually cut into gemstones and are usually referred to as "Gemy".  Crystals in their raw form are often elongated columns or "pillars".  Hence the name _Gempillar_.  _Gempillar_ is a newel post that is strong, steadfast and rooted in the Earth, the greatest foundation of all.  It also symbolizes a unifying theme of mathematics, that of _symmetry_.  Crystals are highly ordered symmetrical objects. This symmetry reflects the higher worlds of Plato's forms and beyond, which the staircase symbolically leads to.

Come, let us see what the stairs lead us to...
