<!-- Hello, my name is Newell Jensen.   Here is my [CV](assets/newell_jensen_cv_2023.pdf). -->

I am deeply intersted in logic, computation, mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Formally I have a BS in Applied Mathematics with a Minor in Physics from the University of California - Davis and an MSEE from the University of Washington.

I enjoy yoga, calisthenics, gymnastics, and other sports such as football ("soccer") and jiu jitsu.

Hope anyone reading this gains something of value from this site in one form or another.
