# About

Hello, my name is Newell Jensen.

Intellectually I enjoy logic, mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Physically I enjoy yoga, calisthenics, gymnastics, and other sports such as football (soccer) and jiu jitsu.

Emotionally I enjoy my family, dogs, and friends.

Hope anyone reading this gains something of value from this site in one form or another.

_Carpe Diem_
