# Gempillar

## Origins

_Gempillar_ is a company started by Newell Jensen that focuses on communicating and demonstrating the knowledge and beauty of mathematics to the masses.  Originally, and in his own leisurement, Newell was working his way through the proofs in _Euclid's Elements_ when he realized the power and importance of _demonstration_.  This importance was noted by the 16th president of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln:

_"You never can make a good lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight."_


## Name

A newel, also called a central pole or support column, is the central supporting pillar of a staircase.  As the anchor of the stairway, a newel must be strong and steadfast to ensure the integrity of the stairwell.  Crystals of the highest quality are usually cut into gemstones and are usually referred to as "Gemy".  Crystals in their raw form are often elongated columns or "pillars".  Hence the name _Gempillar_.  _Gempillar_ is a newel post that is strong, steadfast and rooted in the stability of the Earth.  It also symbolizes a unifying theme of mathematics, that of _symmetry_.  Crystals are highly ordered symmetrical objects. This symmetry reflects the higher worlds of Plato's forms and beyond, which the staircase symbolically leads to.

Come, let us see what the stairs lead us to...
