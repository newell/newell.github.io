# Klein Four-Group
#### November 12, 2023

After having contributed some smaller branches to mathlib, I finally added something to mathlib that didn't really exist before.  More specifically, instead of modifying or adding lemmas and/or theorems to files and subjects that already existed in mathlib, I added a new file for the Klein four-group.  Therefore, this was what I would consider my first main contribution to the project!

It isn't much, at least as far as I am concerned, in the grand scheme of mathlib-things as it is more concrete and specific than a lot of the very abstract and general maths that one currently finds in mathlib.  However, it was still nice to contribute something while learning more at the same time.

The [Klein four-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_four-group) is one of the first finite groups that you encounter in group theory and/or abstract algebra courses.

Instead of listing the source code here, as it might get outdated with changes, here is the [current source code](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/KleinFour.lean) in the mathlib repository.
