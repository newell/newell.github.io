# High Voltage Flyback Converter Project

![High Voltage Flyback Converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5922ead0-73a5-488d-98d9-59223c787acd)

In this project, I designed and hand-soldered a high voltage flyback converter capable of converting a low 4-6V input into a stable 180V output. If you're into high-voltage applications or looking for a power solution for nixie tubes, this project may be of interest to you.

The flyback converter is built around the LT3957A chip and features custom PCBs designed using KiCad. I also ran thorough simulations in LTSpice to ensure the design would perform as expected. Whether you're interested in building something similar or just want to explore the hardware design process, you can check out the full project on [GitHub](https://github.com/newell/hv-flyback-converter).

## Key Features

- **Input/Output**: Converts a 4-6V input to a 180V output.
- **Design**: Based on the LT3957A chip for high efficiency and flexibility.
- **Simulation**: Pre-assembled performance was verified via LTSpice simulation.
- **Custom PCB**: Designed using KiCad and manufactured with a sleek black finish.

## Hands-on Details

I hand-soldered the entire converter, which was a rewarding challenge. The PCB arrived from JLCPCB, and it fit perfectly with the components. I captured images of the final product and you can find more design files and assembly notes in the repository.

This project is part of a broader series of electronics designs that Iâ€™ve been working on, including its role in powering the nixie tubes for a clock I recently built. If you're curious about how the hardware was put together or want to get a closer look at the assembly process, head over to the GitHub page where you'll find all the necessary files and resources.

## Explore the Full Project

For those interested in digging deeper, the full design files, including the KiCad files, LTSpice simulations, and schematics, are open-source and available for download. The project is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware License (CERN OHL), meaning you're free to modify, use, and share the designs.

Whether you're looking to build your own high-voltage converter or just exploring the process of PCB design, I hope you find this project interesting!
